# panda3d pinball

this is a pinball game I made to show case collisions and my collision module.

It depends on 3 of my own packages unfortunately.

panda object creation to turn the custom geometry process into a verts, faces -> object function

vector for some vector math i found cumbersome in other modules

and finally the collision module to make custom collisions a bit
more manageable.

The setup is a bit annoying if you're doing it yourself. The normals of the "line" boundaries have to be adjusted manually to make the normals point into the right direction.
